## Code example(last)
### Python task

```
s = str(input())
l = len(s)-1
c = 1
t = ''
if len(s)==1:
    t = t +s+str(c)
else:
    for i in range(0,l):
        if s[i]==s[i+1]:
            c +=1
        elif s[i]!=s[i+1]:
            t = t + s[i]+str(c)
            c = 1
    for j in range(l,l+1):
        if s[-1]==s[-2]:
            t = t +s[j]+str(c)
        elif s[-1]!=s[-2]:
            t = t +s[j]+str(c)
            c = 1
print(t)
